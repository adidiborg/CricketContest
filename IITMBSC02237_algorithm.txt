Algorithm -

My prediction algorithm is using 5 Filter methods to get average scores. Following are the filters -

I have included all_matches_under6.csv file which has all matches data till 6 overs.
All the below filters have innings parameter included.

Filter 1 - Venue Scores
		   Calculating the average scores at the Venue

Filter 2 - Batting Team vs Bowling Team
		   Average of Batting Team scores runs against Bowling Team 

Filter 3 - Batting Team vs Bowling Team at the Venue
		   Average of Batting Team scores runs against Bowling Team at the venue

Filter 4 - Batsmen scores at the Venue
		   Average combined scores of all batsmen playing today at the venue
		   average = average(batsmen 1) + average(batsmen 2) ++ average(batsmen n)

Filter 5 - Bowler given runs at the Venue
		   Average runs given by all bowlers playing today at the venue
		   average = average(bowler 1) + average(bowler 2) ++ average(bowler n)

prediction = average of Filters 1 to 5
